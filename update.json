[These are currently in a preview state, some minor bugs and coloring issues may be present]\n- Added a small dot on \"New Tab\" button in tags list view\n-- white dot means that there is a tab with ONLY that tag\n-- blue dot means that there is a tab CONTAINING that tag\n- Small redesign of tags list view\n- Added a search field to tags list view\n- Now if the app suspects that api request was blocked by captcha, it will automatically open the webview to give you the option to complete the captcha and unblock future requests\n- Most of the requests now include cookies obtained from the app's webview\n- Changed history viewer to better handle scrolling of a huge list\n- File saving now uses streams, which should fix crashes when downloading very big files and reduce stutters during the process\n- Snatch button in the viewer will now have a green colored subicon if that file is already marked as snatched and present in the current snatch folder (due to how file search works, it can take some time to detect if file is already present if there are too many files in the folder)\n- Snatch button now has a dialog on long tap which allows you to force the download of already snatched item or drop the snatched status from the item\n- Snatching info in the appbar will now show percent progress of the currently downloaded file\n\n\nFixes:\n- Fixed appbar and icon theming using wrong colors under some conditions\n- Fixed wrong search behaviour when adding first booru config to the app\n- Fixed some elements conflicting with system ui\n- Fixed broken thumbnails when favouriting item with \"Hide favourites\" option enabled\n- Fixed a bug when a dot in the booru or file name could break file naming structure\n- Fixed thumbnail loading indicators not updating correctly\n- (Possibly?) fixed small flicker when big images are loading\n- Fixed 403 error on Danbooru\n- Fixed files not snatching on Danbooru\n- Fixed some exceptions related to app init processes\n- Images that are over 100mb will now only be cleared automatically from the cache after a month passes no matter what settings for cache clearing you set\n- Removed timeouts from all requests (some requests will have timeouts readded in the future versions)",
